## Introduction

mod-data-import is responsible for uploading files (see [documentation for file uploading](FileUploadApi.md)), initial handling and sending records for further processing (see [documentation for file processing](FileProcessingApi.md)).

## Compiling

```
   mvn install
```

See that it says "BUILD SUCCESS" near the end.

## Docker

Build the docker container with:

```
   docker build -t mod-data-import .
```

Test that it runs with:

```
   docker run -t -i -p 8081:8081 mod-data-import
```

## Installing the module

Follow the guide of
[Deploying Modules](https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md#example-1-deploying-and-using-a-simple-module)
sections of the Okapi Guide and Reference, which describe the process in detail.

First of all you need a running Okapi instance.
(Note that [specifying](../README.md#setting-things-up) an explicit 'okapiurl' might be needed.)

```
   cd .../okapi
   java -jar okapi-core/target/okapi-core-fat.jar dev
```

We need to declare the module to Okapi:

```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D -   \
   -H "Content-type: application/json"   \
   -d @target/ModuleDescriptor.json \
   http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules
```

That ModuleDescriptor tells Okapi what the module is called, what services it
provides, and how to deploy it.

## Deploying the module

Next we need to deploy the module. There is a deployment descriptor in
`target/DeploymentDescriptor.json`. It tells Okapi to start the module on 'localhost'.

Deploy it via Okapi discovery:

```
curl -w '\n' -D - -s \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @target/DeploymentDescriptor.json  \
  http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules
```

Then we need to enable the module for the tenant:

```
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D -   \
    -H "Content-type: application/json"   \
    -d @target/TenantModuleDescriptor.json \
    http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/<tenant_name>/modules
```

## Maximum upload file size and java heap memory setups

Current implementation supports only storing of the file in a LOCAL_STORAGE (file system of the module). It has a couple of implications:
1. the request for processing the file can be processed only by the same instance of the module, which prevents mod-data-import from scaling 
2. file size that can be uploaded is limited to the java heap memory allocated to the module.
It is necessary to have the size of the java heap equal to the expected max file size plus 10 percent.

#### Example
| File Size | Java Heap size |
|:---------:|:--------------:|
|   256mb   |     270+ mb    |
|   512mb   |     560+ mb    |
|    1GB    |     1.1+ GB    |

## Scalability

To initialise processing of a file user should choose a Job Profile - that information is crucial as it basically contains the instructions on what to do with the uploaded file. However, this process happens after file is uploaded and comes to mod-data-import as a separate request.
External storage is required to make mod-data-import scalable. Implementation of the module has the possibility to read the configuration settings from mod-configuration.
To allow multiple instance deployment, for every instance the same persistent volume must be mounted to the mount point defined by the value of ****_data.import.storage.path_ property.****

### Module properties to set up at mod-configuration

* **_data.import.storage.type_** - type of data storage used for uploaded files. Default value is **LOCAL_STORAGE**. Other implementations for storage should be added.
* **_data.import.storage.path_** - **path where uploaded file will be stored**

## File splitting configuration

The file-splitting process may be configured with the following environment variables:

| Name                                | Type               | Required                 | Default | Description                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SPLIT_FILES_ENABLED`               | `true` or `false`  | yes, if enabling feature | `false` | Whether files should be split into chunks and processed separately                         |
| `RECORDS_PER_SPLIT_FILE`            | integer > 0        | no                       | `1000`  | The maximum number of records to include in a single file                                  |
| `ASYNC_PROCESSOR_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`  | integer (msec) ≥ 0 | no                       | `5000`  | The number of milliseconds between times when the module checks the queue for waiting jobs |
| `ASYNC_PROCESSOR_MAX_WORKERS_COUNT` | integer ≥ 1        | no                       | `1`     | The maximum number of concurrent jobs to process at once, in this instance                 |

For the polling interval, a lower number results in decreased latency between when a job is added to the queue and when it is processed. However, this also results in more frequent database queries, which may impact performance. Note that the number set here is the "worst case" — average waiting would be half of it — and that a few seconds delay on a large import is hardly noticeable.

The worker count is useful for production/multi-tenant environments, where you might want to provide more capacity without additional instances.  **However, note that this may cause some odd behavior when only one user is running a job, as multiple parts may appear to complete together.**

## Interaction with AWS S3/Minio

This module uses S3-compatible storage as part of the file upload process. The following environment variables must be set with values for your S3-compatible storage (AWS S3, Minio Server):

| Name                    | Type              | Required           | Default                  | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AWS_URL`               | URL as string     | yes                | `http://127.0.0.1:9000/` | URL of S3-compatible storage                                                  |
| `AWS_REGION`            | string            | yes                | _none_                   | S3 region                                                                     |
| `AWS_BUCKET`            | string            | yes                | _none_                   | Bucket to store and retrieve data                                             |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | string            | yes                | _none_                   | S3 access key                                                                 |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | string            | yes                | _none_                   | S3 secret key                                                                 |
| `AWS_SDK`               | `true` or `false` | no, if using MinIO | `false`                  | If AWS S3 is being used (`true` if so, `false` other platforms such as MinIO) |
| `S3_FORCEPATHSTYLE`     | `true` or `false` | no                 | `false`                  | If path-style requests should be used instead of virtual-hosted style         |

Path-style vs virtual-hosted style requests are described [on the AWS S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html#path-style-access).

> [!WARNING]
> It is possible for files to be partially uploaded but abandoned in the UI. This module makes no effort to detect these cases and proactively delete them.
>
> Instead, use the retention policies built into AWS S3 and MinIO, as described [here](https://wiki.folio.org/display/FOLIOtips/Detailed+Release+Notes+for+Data+Import+Splitting+Feature#DetailedReleaseNotesforDataImportSplittingFeature-Garbagecollectionofcloudstoredfiles:).

## Queue prioritization algorithm

This covers the following environment variables:

> [!NOTE]
> None of these are required; if not set, the following default values will be used.

| Name                                  | Type (unit)       | Default  | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `SCORE_PART_NUMBER_LAST_REFERENCE`    | integer           | `100`    | Does not really matter due to the small range                                                                                                                                                |

For information on what these mean, how to configure them, how scores are calculated, and even a playground to try experiment with different values, please see [this wiki page](https://wiki.folio.org/display/FOLIOtips/Detailed+Release+Notes+for+Data+Import+Splitting+Feature#DetailedReleaseNotesforDataImportSplittingFeature-QueuePrioritizationAlgorithm).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To disable an individual metric (or the prioritization altogether), set the value(s) to `0`.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend the suggested values above, however, there is a lot of room for customization and extension as needed.  Please see the doc for more information.

## System user

> [!WARNING]
> This module creates a system user upon installation with the following (if splitting is enabled):
>
> - Name `SystemDataImport`
> - Username `data-import-system-user` (customizable via env variable `SYSTEM_PROCESSING_USERNAME`)
> - Password customizable via env variable `SYSTEM_PROCESSING_PASSWORD` (**must be set, or the module will fail to start**)
> - [permissions to perform any import-related activities](/src/main/resources/permissions.txt).

To enable asynchronous job launching (as part of the file splitting process), the module creates
a system user upon installation. The system user is named `SystemDataImport`,
and its credentials may be customized with the following environment variables:

| Name                         | Type   | Required                     | Default                   | Description          |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `SYSTEM_PROCESSING_USERNAME` | string | no                           | `data-import-system-user` | System user username |
| `SYSTEM_PROCESSING_PASSWORD` | string | yes, if splitting is enabled | _none_                    | System user password |

This user is granted [many of the same permissions](/src/main/resources/permissions.txt) as the module for the
`/data-import/uploadDefinitions/{uploadDefinitionId}/processFiles` endpoint. This enables this
user to complete any import-related tasks across compatible modules.

## Interaction with Kafka

All modules involved in data import (mod-data-import, mod-source-record-manager, mod-source-record-storage, mod-inventory, mod-invoice) are communicating via Kafka directly. Therefore, to enable data import Kafka should be set up properly and all the necessary parameters should be set for the modules.

**Properties that are required for mod-data-import to interact with Kafka:**

* `KAFKA_HOST`
* `KAFKA_PORT`
* `OKAPI_URL`
* `ENV` (unique env ID)

## Other system properties

Initial handling of the uploaded file means chunking it and sending records for processing in other modules. The chunk size can be adjusted for different files, otherwise default values will be used:

* "_file.processing.marc.raw.buffer.chunk.size_": 50 - applicable to MARC files in binary format
* "_file.processing.marc.json.buffer.chunk.size_": 50 - applicable to json files with MARC data in json format
* "_file.processing.marc.xml.buffer.chunk.size_": 10 - applicable to xml files with MARC data in xml format
* "_file.processing.edifact.buffer.chunk.size_": 10 - applicable to EDIFACT files

## Script to upload a batch of MARC records

[The `scripts` directory](scripts) contains a shell-script, `load-marc-data-into-folio.sh`, and a file with a sample of 100 MARC records, `sample100.marc`. This script can be used to upload any batch of MARC files automatically, using the same sequence of WSAPI operations as the Secret Button. First, login to a FOLIO backend service using [the Okapi command-line utility](https://github.com/thefrontside/okapi.rb) or any other means that leaves definitions of the Okapi URL, tenant and token in the `.okapi` file in the home directory. Then run the script, naming the MARC file as its own argument:

```
scripts$ echo OKAPI_URL=https://folio-snapshot-stable-okapi.dev.folio.org > ~/.okapi
scripts$ echo OKAPI_TENANT=diku >> ~/.okapi
scripts$ okapi login
username: diku_admin
password: ************
Login successful. Token saved to /Users/mike/.okapi
